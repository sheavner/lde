	* gpm support only works on my system when I am root?  Most lde
	usage is probaby done as root, so is this a big deal?
	
	* block mode: make cursors scroll window one line at a time?
	
	* nofs_init: called at startup and uses ted/remy's slow sizelookup
	function.  Should reconsider call, maybe just set
	sb->blocksize=1024, nothing else should matter.

	* recover.c: add option to really undelete files, not just create
	a copy somewhere else, but mark all it's blocks used and create a
	dir entry for it (I'm not going to do this anytime soon).

	* Implement a curses window that can be used to select files to
 	undelete. (like command line lde -I 1 --recoverable).  Could spawn
 	another lde to run create a file with all deleted inodes, display
 	the file in a curses window, then let user pick files to undelete.

	* Add toggle inode/block in use/bad flag.  Also a reread tables
 	from disk command in case the user edits the tables.

	* If you edit a block with inodes on it in block_mode, then view it
 	under inode mode, the inode will be incorrect until you view
 	another inode and come back to this one.  (This is only a problem
 	with ext2fs -- see EXT2_read_inode).  (***Actually***, it is a
 	bigger problem with the other fs's which store the inode tables in
 	memory.)

	* Put up more super block info.  It was fine for Minix, but ext2
 	has a lot more "junk".

	* Throw in more inode info.  What are the inode.flags for ext2
 	anyways?
