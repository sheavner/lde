This binary is a lot bigger than it needs to be because it has been
compiled with static libraries.  If you recompile and link 
with shared libs, the binary should be around 70k after stripping.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES SINCE 2.3.4

	* autodetect fs types when compiling - newer 2.1 kernels don't
	  have the xiafs headers.

	* use llseek or subsitute to access partitions/files > 2GB.

	* command line equivalents for recovery functions

	* terminal dumps display as much info as curses mode

	* errors are now printed to stderr instead of stdout
	
	* directory mode will display entire directories at once.
	Improved navigation in directory mode.

	* block mode scrolling is nicer - no longer locked on a block

	* option to view/edit blocks as just ASCII (without hex display).

	* basic gpm support - can navigate menus and move the cursor in
	block mode (whoopie), but since I upgraded to gpm0.14 and
        ncurses4.2, lde and the gpm examples only work when I'm root??

	* configure script - So	far I've only tested lde on a 486
        system and I don't think it will work on a big endian machine.

	* fix instances where last block of nofs was not accessible

   	* blanked_indirects fix - workaround for Linux 2.0 bug.  All
 	indirect blocks of deleted files are set to 0.  These hacks will
 	work to recover a small file, but will fail for large fragmented
 	files.

	* triple indirect block support

	* indexed block motions in block mode - makes prev/next commands
	move relative to the current inode so it is possible to page
	through a file's data even if it is fragmented across the disk.
