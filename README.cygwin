
To access your drives under cygwin, you have to do something like this ...

mount -s -b -f //./physicaldrive0 /dev/hda

Where you can use physicaldrive0, physicaldrive1 corresponding to each
harddisk installed on your system.  For partitions, something like
this is supposed to work, but I'm not sure it really does ...

mount -s -b -f //./C /dev/hda1
